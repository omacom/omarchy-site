 * paints, looping. No audio is fetched for that.
 *
 * Turning the sound on loads the track, starts it where the clock is, and
 * from then on the sound itself is read through the Web Audio analyser on
 * its way to the speakers - thirty-two bands and a live beat detector - so
 * the picture is exactly what is playing. Turning it off again only turns
 * the volume down, after the analyser: the track keeps playing and the
 * sound is there again the moment it is asked for. With the sound off the
 * field goes back to the timeline, at the track's position, so it looks
 * the way the page opened; the live reading is for when it can be heard.

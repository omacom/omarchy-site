          the front card keeps it and closes too, but the name is what you
          are reading when you decide, and on a phone it is the one target
          that is never half-covered by a neighbouring card. No plate: a
          filled box sat on top of the preview. The name is set in the
          theme's own two inks, and the dimmer decides which is which: the
          lighter one fills the letters and the darker one edges them. On a
          dark theme that is text on ground; on a light theme it is the
          the page's cream or white, edged in the theme's text colour, since
          dark letters would sink into the dimmer. */}

 * mix-blend-mode inside one has no backdrop to blend against, which is why
 * the bar used to look identical whether or not a lit pixel was behind it.
 *
 * Fixed rather than absolute, so it tracks the sticky bar as the hero scrolls
 * under it. Inert to pointers and to screen readers, and it carries only the
 * labels: the mark and Install keep their own colours and stay with the real
 * header. Colours are pre-compensated (--t-hdr-*), so over the plain field
 * background the difference resolves back to the authored colour and nothing
 * looks different until a pixel actually passes behind.

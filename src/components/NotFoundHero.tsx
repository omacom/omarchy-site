 * The 404, built as the hero is built: one field of pixels that resolves
 * into a word, except the word is NOT FOUND. The letters are cut in the
 * wordmark's own hand - see scripts/build-not-found-glyph.mjs - so a dead
 * link lands somewhere that is recognisably the same place, rather than on
 * an apology in a different typeface.
 *
 * It answers the cursor and takes a click the way the wordmark does. The
 * click goes home instead of opening the theme picker, which is the one
 * thing a person on this page is actually trying to do.

            the same letterforms read as a smaller typeface on this page.

            NOT FOUND is 102 cells against the wordmark's 81, so it cannot
            have both inside one box: at the wordmark's width its cells come
            out a fifth smaller. So the two are separated. The box fixes only
            the height, which is what the axis is measured from - 19 cell-rows,
            exactly the wordmark's - and the word inside it is sized off the
            same --pxc the hero's lattice is built from, so one cell here is
            one cell there. It asks for the width that gives it, and takes
            what there is when the viewport cannot supply it. */}

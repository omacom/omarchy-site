/**
 * Aligns [data-px-snap] elements to the hero field's lattice, under one
 * hard rule: a snap happens before a frame paints or not at all.
 *
 * Only mark elements that live and die with the hero. The lattice does, and
 * anything longer-lived is snapped on the home page and unsnapped everywhere
 * else, which the reader sees as the control jumping on arrival and again on
 * the way out. The bar's controls were marked and did exactly that; they take
 * their sizes from --pxc in plain CSS instead, which needs no measurement and
 * so cannot move. The
 * first snap runs in a layout effect before first paint when the webfonts are
 * cached, which is every visit after the first; on a cold cache the page
 * simply keeps its natural layout. Afterwards the only snaps are grid
 * events from the field, which fire inside its own pre-frame measure
 * (mount, resize), so they also land before the next paint. There are no
 * timers, no settle passes, and nothing that can move a control the
 * reader is already looking at.

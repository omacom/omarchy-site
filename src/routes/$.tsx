 * ("Runs great on ancient hardware", "#omarchy-workstations") and two

 * paragraphs are as often a list of names or a single sponsorship as they
 * are a summary. The set is small, fixed and known, so it is written out.
 *
 * Anything not listed still falls back to the page's own title and first
 * paragraph, which is right for a page added later and never revisited.
